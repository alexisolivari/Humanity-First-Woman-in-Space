### What is Humanity?

_Humanity: First Woman In Space_ transports you into the body of the first woman to go into space.  View the world through the eyes of Astronaut Turova as she navigates through the male dominated world of astronaut training. Experience how it feels when most people around you don't believe in you. 

Research shows that this type of experience can reduce your bias: by playing _Humanity: First Woman In Space_ , you are not only having fun but you are increasing harmony in the world!

### Compatibility: PCVR

This is a **PCVR experience** that will work on any SteamVR compatible device! It will therefore work with an Oculus Quest 1 or 2 using an Oculus Link or Virtual Desktop. 

### Status

_Humanity: First Woman In Space_  is still in development and for now only the first part of the story - before the Rocket Launch - is available. We are looking forward to your feedback to shape the second part of the story, which happens in the spaceship. The second part of the story will include: asteroid shooting, panels fixing, 0 gravity flying and more! 

### How does it work?

_Humanity: First Woman In Space_  is based on scientific research about increasing empathy and decreasing bias/ discrimination through the use of Virtual Reality.  If you’re interested in learning more about these topics, please reach out to us via contact@wondder.io
